You can use VSCode or any other IDE with spring boot tooling installed for running your local server after the build above. 
In VSCode - its the Spring boot extension pack, for others you need to check which is best suited. 

The Opn API definitions are in the folder openapiyaml. Any change in the API must reflect here first, and then the server generated code should be updated.

## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springdoc-openapi](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi)

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/  

Change default port value in application.properties
